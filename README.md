#Nursing Task Manager

We are creating a web form that allows students of the Nursing Program to manage a list of critical tasks that they must complete over the time in the program. The student user interface will allow users to mark tasks accordingly and see their progress throughout the semester.  We will also be incorporating an administrator user interface for appropriate faculty/staff to student progress.  Admins will be able query student data during the semester and will be able to manage the website moving forward.
